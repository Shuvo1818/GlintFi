# GlintFi - On-Chain Precious Metals & DeFi Credit Lines

GlintFi is a premium, decentralized wealth management application built on the Stellar network. It enables users to secure their capital by investing in tokenized precious metals (Synthetic Gold `sXAU` and Synthetic Silver `sXAG`), set up automated savings plans (Gullak Metal SIP), borrow USDC instantly against their precious metal holdings, and interact directly with Stellar Soroban smart contracts.

Developed as part of the **Stellar Journey to Mastery** program.

## 🌟 Program Submissions (Level 1 & Level 2)

### 🥇 Level 1: White Belt Deliverables
1. **Wallet Integration**: Freighter Wallet connection and account state visualization.
2. **Asset Activation (Trustlines)**: Instant activation and on-chain trustline registration for `sXAU` (Gold) and `sXAG` (Silver) tokens.
3. **Precious Metal Swap Engine**: Dynamic on-chain swaps between XLM, USDC, sXAU, and sXAG.
4. **Transaction History**: Real-time transaction record tracking and historical ledger view.

### 🥈 Level 2: Yellow Belt Deliverables
1. **Multi-Wallet Support**: Full integration supporting both **Freighter Wallet** (browser extension) and **Albedo Wallet** (web-based delegated signer).
2. **Deployed Contract Address**:
   * **Contract ID (Native Stellar Asset Contract - SAC):** `CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC`
   * *Description:* Represents the official Native XLM token within the Soroban smart contract layer on the Stellar Testnet.
3. **Transaction Hash of a Contract Call**:
   * **Transaction Hash (Verifiable on Stellar Explorer):** `b1ff6ca944e57106921407fea4c9e24f11ac1dd167e81eb6603ee5b68754eff3`
   * *Link:* [Stellar.expert Testnet Explorer](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/b1ff6ca944e57106921407fea4c9e24f11ac1dd167e81eb6603ee5b68754eff3)
   * *Details:* Invokes the `transfer` method on the SAC contract, transferring native XLM from the sender to the distributor vault on-chain.
4. **Custom Rust Soroban Smart Contract**:
   * Written in **Rust** inside the project workspace (`contracts/vault`).
   * Implements the custom `GullakVault` contract with `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `get_balance` methods.
5. **Real-Time Transaction Status**: Full loader animations (`Simulating...`, `Signing...`, `Submitting...`, `Success!`).
6. **Explicit Error Handling**: Handling signature rejections, Soroban simulation errors, and network RPC timeouts.
7. **Real-Time SSE Event Integration**: Updates balances and transaction history instantly on-chain without page refresh using a real-time Server-Sent Events (SSE) operation stream.

## 🦀 Custom Rust Soroban Smart Contract
We have developed and included a custom, native Soroban smart contract written in **Rust** inside the project workspace:
* **Path:** `[contracts/vault](file:///d:/GlintFi/contracts/vault)`
* **Source Code:** `[lib.rs](file:///d:/GlintFi/contracts/vault/src/lib.rs)` implements the custom `GullakVault` contract with `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `get_balance` methods.
* **Tests:** `[test.rs](file:///d:/GlintFi/contracts/vault/src/test.rs)` includes a comprehensive unit test verifying the deposit and withdraw functions.
* **Build Config:** Workspace integration is configured in the root `[Cargo.toml](file:///d:/GlintFi/Cargo.toml)` and contract-specific `[Cargo.toml](file:///d:/GlintFi/contracts/vault/Cargo.toml)`.

## 🛠️ Yellow Belt Key Features Implemented

### 1. Soroban DeFi Yield Vault (Contract called from Frontend)
Inside the **Gullak** tab, users can switch to the **Soroban Yield Vault** sub-section:
* **Read-only Invocation:** The app invokes the contract's `balance` function via RPC simulation, retrieving the user's live wrapped XLM balance on-chain in real-time.
* **Write Invocation:** The app builds, simulates, prompts signature (Freighter/Albedo), and broadcasts a contract `transfer` transaction, depositing XLM directly into the yield vault.

### 2. Real-Time Transaction Status Visible
During smart contract execution, the UI displays step-by-step state loaders:
1. `Simulating Contract Footprint...` (fetching ledger resource footprints)
2. `Awaiting Wallet Signature...` (populating pop-up for user approval)
3. `Broadcasting to Stellar Testnet...` (submitting to Horizon node)
4. `Deposit Confirmed Successfully!` (rendering verifiable explorer transaction link)

### 3. Explicit Error Handling (3 Error Types Handled)
The app captures and displays user-friendly error banners for three specific failure conditions:
* **Signature Rejection:** Handled when the user declines the wallet signing prompt.
* **Soroban Simulation/Execution Error:** Handled when the contract simulation fails (e.g., due to insufficient funds or fee calculations).
* **Network RPC Timeout:** Handled when the connection to the Soroban RPC server fails or times out.
